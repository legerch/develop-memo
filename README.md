This repository is used as a **personal "memo"** for multiples subjects/applications/configurations/etc...  
Some parts are really detailled, some are brief and some are still in construction (but with links to alternative ressources).

> Note: It is mainly written in _English_ but some parts are still in _French_ (which is my native language, mainly used when lacking time on writing tutorial)
